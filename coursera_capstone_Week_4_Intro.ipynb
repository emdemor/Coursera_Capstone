    "It is very common for people to have to move to another city. The reasons for this are quite diverse and can involve professional opportunities, personal reasons, among others. This process can be quite difficult for some people, as it involves adapting to a new and possibly different environment. Although two cities may be completely different, they may have neighborhoods with similar characteristics in common. Knowledge of this information can be crucial when choosing a new place to live in a new city. Thus, a person can choose to move to a neighborhood in a new city with similar characteristics to the neighborhood in the city where he lives and is already acclimated.\n",

    "For this project, I choose to work with cities in Brazil, the country where I live. We have two of the largest cities in the world with very distinct characteristics: SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Locally, each of this places acts like professional centers attracting professionals and companies. Sometimes, a company in one of this cities is interesting in a professional that lives in the other city. Certainly, if the professional find a similiar  neighbourhood, he will be more likely to accept an offer if it is professionally interesting\n"
